## 🚀 About Us

Antistar is an independent deep-tech research organization developing **next-generation energy systems**, **ultra-high-energy particle accelerators**, and **breakthrough propulsion technologies**.  
We operate a single, self-contained research facility dedicated to **pure scientific advancement** — no weapons, no compromises.

Our focus:
- **Antimatter Production & Containment** (target: in-house antihydrogen within 10 years)
- **Energy Systems & Exotic Propulsion**
- **Superluminal Theory Prototyping**
- **Applied Research in Computing, Medicine, and Physics**

We believe in **purpose-built infrastructure**, **vertically integrated research**, and **pioneering science that redefines the possible**.

## 🏗 Current Phase (Pre-Seed)

We are currently building our **software backbone** for accelerator design, simulation, and early-stage experimental planning — all powered by a lean but powerful HPC and control stack.

Key capabilities in development:
- **Beamline and accelerator simulation** (GEANT4, MAD-X, COMSOL)
- **Real-time control systems** (EPICS, LabVIEW, OpenPLC)
- **High-volume data analysis pipelines** (ROOT, Python, TensorFlow)
- **Physics model integration** for superluminal theory testing

## 📅 Roadmap

**Year 0–2**
- Complete accelerator simulation and control software stack
- Deploy HPC cluster + DAQ testbed
- Validate initial superluminal simulation models

**Year 3–5**
- Construct first experimental beamline
- Begin antimatter precursor experiments (positrons, antiprotons)
- Integrate AI-optimized beam control

**Year 6–10**
- Achieve controlled antihydrogen production
- Deploy experimental propulsion prototypes
- Expand research into computing, medicine, and advanced physics
